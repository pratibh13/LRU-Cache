# LRU-Cache web Application

This project is a web application that implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache system. It consists of a backend server built with Go (Golang) and a frontend client built with React.
 
## Getting Started
 
Follow these steps to run the application locally:
 
### Prerequisites

- GO
- React JS
- Docker
- Docker Compose
 
### Instructions
 
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/pratibh13/LRU-Cache.git
 
2) Navigate to the project directory: cd lru-cache-web-app
3) Build and run the application using Docker Compose: docker-compose up --build
Once the containers are up and running, you can access the frontend app at http://localhost:3000 and the backend API at http://localhost:8080.
